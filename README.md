# PacMen-Exercise
## Exercise on creating unlimited bouncing pacmen
<p>In this exercise, I created two buttons, one that allows you to add individual PacMen to the page and one that "starts the game" (aka makes them bounce around the page). The PacMen bounce off of the walls so that they always stay in view. The user can add as many PacMen as the like.</p>
